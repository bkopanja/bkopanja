I'm a software development professional with 15+ years of experience in various areas (mobile, frontend, backend). Ex Director of Engineering @ [Bonfire](https://bonfire.com) where I enjoyed growing a fully remote team and working with some of the best people I've met in my career. I'm still involved with Bonfire as a contractor on a position of Solutions Architect where I help lead the teck advancement of the platform.

## What's currently going on in my life (professionally ofc 🙂)

Well beleve it or not, I’m currently learning Python - it's that simple, not ML, not Cryptpo or something else super "hot" right now... Plain and simple Python 🙂!

Every senior software developer can "hack" a thing or two using any language, but I want to deeply familiarize myself with Python as I never had a chance to do so in my day-to-day work so I made it my missin to kick-off several personal projects in 2023. written fully in Python and grow my public github repo-land, it's been about time 🤘
